                Smart automations for development teams

            <p>
                Arcane Studio is a collection of productivity-boosting tools built on top of the
                <a href="https://arcane.engineer/engine" target="_blank">Arcane Engine</a> - it takes
                natural language instructions - <strong>Tasks</strong> - and executes them on your behalf using its capabilities,
                which include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reading, writing and editing code</li>
                <li>Interacting with issues, tickets, wikis, etc via <a href="https://docs.pr-pilot.ai/integrations.html">Integrations</a></li>
                <li>Searching the internet and scraping websites</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This studio uses tasks as a basic unit of work to create higher-level automations that can
                be shared and reused across teams. Everything you see is built using our <a href="https://arcane.engineer/development-kit" target="_blank">Development Kit</a>,
                which makes it easy for you to build your own tools.
